# AI Interviewer 🎤🧠💼

**Conduct real-time mock interviews with an AI interviewer.**  

This project repurposes KoljaB's superb [RealtimeVoiceChat](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeVoiceChat) into an interview-coaching experience. Speak naturally, receive instant feedback, and iterate on your answers without needing a human interviewer present.

> ℹ️ **Status:** actively adapting the original voice chat experience into an AI interviewer. Core audio/LLM streaming is inherited from RealtimeVoiceChat; interview-specific flows are evolving in this fork.

## What's Under the Hood?

A sophisticated client-server system built for low-latency interaction:

1.  🎙️ **Capture:** Your voice is captured by your browser.
2.  ➡️ **Stream:** Audio chunks are whisked away via WebSockets to a Python backend.
3.  ✍️ **Transcribe:** `RealtimeSTT` rapidly converts your speech to text.
4.  🤔 **Think:** The text is sent to an LLM (like Ollama or OpenAI) for processing.
5.  🗣️ **Synthesize:** The AI's text response is turned back into speech using `RealtimeTTS`.
6.  ⬅️ **Return:** The generated audio is streamed back to your browser for playback.
7.  🔄 **Interrupt:** Jump in anytime! The system handles interruptions gracefully.

## Key Features ✨

*   **Mock Interview Flows:** Tailor the interviewer persona and question strategy through `system_prompt.txt` and custom prompts.
*   **Fluid Conversation:** Speak and listen in natural language, powered by the original low-latency pipeline.
*   **Real-Time Feedback:** Observe partial transcripts and interviewer reactions instantly.
*   **Smart Turn-Taking:** Silence detection (`turndetect.py`) keeps the interview cadence natural.
*   **Flexible AI Brains:** Pluggable LLM backends (Ollama default, OpenAI support via `llm_module.py`).
*   **Customizable Voices:** Choose from different Text-to-Speech engines (Kokoro, Coqui, Orpheus via `audio_module.py`).
*   **Web Interface:** Clean and simple UI using Vanilla JS and the Web Audio API.
*   **Dockerized Deployment:** Recommended setup using Docker Compose for easier dependency management.

## Interviewer Customisation 🧩

The following touchpoints steer the interview experience:

* **system_prompt.txt** – Define interviewer tone, evaluation criteria, and follow-up tactics.
* **speech_pipeline_manager.py** – Extend the pipeline with question scheduling, scoring logic, or interviewer personas.
* **static/app.js** – Surface interview progress, timers, or scoring overlays in the browser UI.

Because the upstream project already provides robust audio streaming, most interview logic can be layered by adjusting prompts and state management without rewriting the low-level pipeline.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

*   **Backend:** Python < 3.13, FastAPI
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS, Web Audio API, AudioWorklets)
*   **Communication:** WebSockets
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Core AI/ML Libraries:**
    *   `RealtimeSTT` (Speech-to-Text)
    *   `RealtimeTTS` (Text-to-Speech)
    *   `transformers` (Turn detection, Tokenization)
    *   `torch` / `torchaudio` (ML Framework)
    *   `ollama` / `openai` (LLM Clients)
*   **Audio Processing:** `numpy`, `scipy`

## Before You Dive In: Prerequisites 🏊‍♀️

This project leverages powerful AI models, which have some requirements:

*   **Operating System:**
    *   **Docker:** Linux is recommended for the best GPU integration with Docker.
    *   **Manual:** The provided script (`install.bat`) is for Windows. Manual steps are possible on Linux/macOS but may require more troubleshooting (especially for DeepSpeed).
*   **🐍 Python:** 3.9 or higher (if setting up manually).
*   **🚀 GPU:** **A powerful CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU is *highly recommended***, especially for faster STT (Whisper) and TTS (Coqui). Performance on CPU-only or weaker GPUs will be significantly slower.
    *   The setup assumes **CUDA 12.1**. Adjust PyTorch installation if you have a different CUDA version.
    *   **Docker (Linux):** Requires [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).
*   **🐳 Docker (Optional but Recommended):** Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2+ for the containerized setup.
*   **🧠 Ollama (Optional):** If using the Ollama backend *without* Docker, install it separately and pull your desired models. The Docker setup includes an Ollama service.
*   **🔑 OpenAI API Key (Optional):** If using the OpenAI backend, set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable (e.g., in a `.env` file or passed to Docker).

## Getting Started: Installation & Setup ⚙️

**Clone the repository first:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeVoiceChat.git
cd RealtimeVoiceChat
```

Now, choose your adventure:

<details>
<summary><strong>🚀 Option A: Docker Installation (Recommended for Linux/GPU)</strong></summary>

This is the most straightforward method, bundling the application, dependencies, and even Ollama into manageable containers.

1.  **Build the Docker images:**
    *(This takes time! It downloads base images, installs Python/ML dependencies, and pre-downloads the default STT model.)*
    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```
    *(If you want to customize models/settings in `code/*.py`, do it **before** this step!)*

2.  **Start the services (App & Ollama):**
    *(Runs containers in the background. GPU access is configured in `docker-compose.yml`.)*
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    Give them a minute to initialize.

3.  **(Crucial!) Pull your desired Ollama Model:**
    *(This is done *after* startup to keep the main app image smaller and allow model changes without rebuilding. Execute this command to pull the default model into the running Ollama container.)*
    ```bash
    # Pull the default model (adjust if you configured a different one in server.py)
    docker compose exec ollama ollama pull hf.co/bartowski/huihui-ai_Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501-abliterated-GGUF:Q4_K_M

    # (Optional) Verify the model is available
    docker compose exec ollama ollama list
    ```

4.  **Stopping the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

5.  **Restarting:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

6.  **Viewing Logs / Debugging:**
    *   Follow app logs: `docker compose logs -f app`
    *   Follow Ollama logs: `docker compose logs -f ollama`
    *   Save logs to file: `docker compose logs app > app_logs.txt`

<summary><strong>🛠️ Option B: Manual Installation (Windows Script / venv)</strong></summary>

This method requires managing the Python environment yourself. It offers more direct control but can be trickier, especially regarding ML dependencies.

**B1) Using the Windows Install Script:**

1.  Ensure you meet the prerequisites (Python, potentially CUDA drivers).
2.  Run the script. It attempts to create a venv, install PyTorch for CUDA 12.1, a compatible DeepSpeed wheel, and other requirements.
    ```batch
    install.bat
    ```
    *(This opens a new command prompt within the activated virtual environment.)*
    Proceed to the **"Running the Application"** section.

**B2) Manual Steps (Linux/macOS/Windows):**

1.  **Create & Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Linux/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2.  **Upgrade Pip:**
    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

3.  **Navigate to Code Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd code
    ```

4.  **Install PyTorch (Crucial Step - Match Your Hardware!):**
    *   **With NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 12.1 Example):**
        ```bash
        # Verify your CUDA version! Adjust 'cu121' and the URL if needed.
        pip install torch==2.5.1+cu121 torchaudio==2.5.1+cu121 torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
        ```
    *   **CPU Only (Expect Slow Performance):**
        ```bash
        # pip install torch torchaudio torchvision
        ```
    *   *Find other PyTorch versions:* [https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)

5.  **Install Other Requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *   **Note on DeepSpeed:** The `requirements.txt` may include DeepSpeed. Installation can be complex, especially on Windows. The `install.bat` tries a precompiled wheel. If manual installation fails, you might need to build it from source or consult resources like [deepspeedpatcher](https://github.com/erew123/deepspeedpatcher) (use at your own risk). Coqui TTS performance benefits most from DeepSpeed.

## Running the Application ▶️

**If using Docker:**
Your application is already running via `docker compose up -d`! Check logs using `docker compose logs -f app`.

**If using Manual/Script Installation:**

1.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS: source ../venv/bin/activate
    # Windows: ..\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the `code` directory** (if not already there):
    ```bash
    cd code
    ```
3.  **Start the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

**Accessing the Client (Both Methods):**

1.  Open your web browser to `http://localhost:8000` (or your server's IP if running remotely/in Docker on another machine).
2.  **Grant microphone permissions** when prompted.
3.  Click **"Start"** to begin chatting! Use "Stop" to end and "Reset" to clear the conversation.

## Configuration Deep Dive 🔧

Want to tweak the AI's voice, brain, or how it listens? Modify the Python files in the `code/` directory.

**⚠️ Important Docker Note:** If using Docker, make any configuration changes *before* running `docker compose build` to ensure they are included in the image.

*   **TTS Engine & Voice (`server.py`, `audio_module.py`):**
    *   Change `START_ENGINE` in `server.py` to `"coqui"`, `"kokoro"`, or `"orpheus"`.
    *   Adjust engine-specific settings (e.g., voice model path for Coqui, speaker ID for Orpheus, speed) within `AudioProcessor.__init__` in `audio_module.py`.
*   **LLM Backend & Model (`server.py`, `llm_module.py`):**
    *   Set `LLM_START_PROVIDER` (`"ollama"` or `"openai"`) and `LLM_START_MODEL` (e.g., `"hf.co/..."` for Ollama, model name for OpenAI) in `server.py`. Remember to pull the Ollama model if using Docker (see Installation Step A3).
    *   Customize the AI's personality by editing `system_prompt.txt`.
*   **STT Settings (`transcribe.py`):**
    *   Modify `DEFAULT_RECORDER_CONFIG` to change the Whisper model (`model`), language (`language`), silence thresholds (`silence_limit_seconds`), etc. The default `base.en` model is pre-downloaded during the Docker build.
*   **Turn Detection Sensitivity (`turndetect.py`):**
    *   Adjust pause duration constants within the `TurnDetector.update_settings` method.
*   **SSL/HTTPS (`server.py`):**
    *   Set `USE_SSL = True` and provide paths to your certificate (`SSL_CERT_PATH`) and key (`SSL_KEY_PATH`) files.
    *   **Docker Users:** You'll need to adjust `docker-compose.yml` to map the SSL port (e.g., 443) and potentially mount your certificate files as volumes.
    <details>
    <summary><strong>Generating Local SSL Certificates (Windows Example w/ mkcert)</strong></summary>

    1.  Install Chocolatey package manager if you haven't already.
    2.  Install mkcert: `choco install mkcert`
    3.  Run Command Prompt *as Administrator*.
    4.  Install a local Certificate Authority: `mkcert -install`
    5.  Generate certs (replace `your.local.ip`): `mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 your.local.ip`
        *   This creates `.pem` files (e.g., `localhost+3.pem` and `localhost+3-key.pem`) in the current directory. Update `SSL_CERT_PATH` and `SSL_KEY_PATH` in `server.py` accordingly. Remember to potentially mount these into your Docker container.
